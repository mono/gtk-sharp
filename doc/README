Compiling and installing the Gtk# Documentation

Compile and install monodoc
    cd monodoc/
	./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr/local
	make
	make install

Compile the documentation for gtk-sharp

    	cd gtk-sharp/doc
	make assemble
	cp gtk-sharp-docs.* `pkg-config monodoc --variable=sourcesdir`

If things are fine, you should have in the Monodoc sources directory the 
following files:

gtk-sharp-docs.source
gtk-sharp-docs.tree
gtk-sharp-docs.zip
netdocs.source
netdocs.tree
netdocs.zip

Start monodoc, by typing `monodoc'

If it doesn't run, please change the paths in the makefile and point
ASSEMBLER and BROWSER to where you put your assembler.exe and browser.exe.
