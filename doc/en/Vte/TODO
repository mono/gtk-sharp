TODO doc for Vte namespace.

There are in total 25 xml to document in Vte. Right now there are 25 xml not documented in any proportion.
The idea is to have a easy way to know what documentation is missing, if you want to help or are helping please take out the xml that you commit
from the missing list. For documentation that take some time to finish (like HTML, TextBuffer, etc) the best is that you but your name and email
next to the file in this list to acknowledge that you are working in it (is recommendable that you suscribe to the mono-docs  mailing list).

Following is the list of undocumented xml:
