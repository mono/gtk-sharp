    <summary>
    PropertyEditors which act as intermediaries between 
    <see cref="N:GConf" /> and <see cref="N:Gtk" /> widgets. 
    They are analoguous to the Controller of the MVC design pattern.  
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>
      PropertyEditors do two things:
      <ul>
       <li>
       They listen to GConf notifications, and update 
       widgets to reflect any changes in a GConf setting.
       </li>
       <li>
       They connect to the various "changed" signals on a widget, 
       and update GConf to reflect the widget's current state.
       </li>
      </ul>
      </para>
      <para>
      Also provided are a utility class called 
      <see cref="T:GConf.PropertyEditors.EditorShell" />,
      which exposes a simple API to automatically 
      construct PropertyEditors for a 
      <see cref="T:Glade.XML" /> UI.
