Before beginning work on something, please post your intentions to the
mailing list (gtk-sharp-list@ximian.com).  Duplication of effort just gets
folks cranky in general.

Code contributions can be made in the form of pull requests on GitHub,
through https://github.com/mono/gtk-sharp or by attaching patches to bug
reports. Please make sure the patch is produced using 'git format-patch'.


Getting Started:
----------------

    Getting started with "hacking" Gtk# can seem formidable at first.  However
    there is some additional information already written, to help you get
    up and going.

    Those wishing to "hack" at Gtk#, are encouraged to also read
    sources/README.

    If you still have more questions or need assitance, you can get help on
    the Gtk# mailing list and the #gtk# or #mono IRC channels.  (Information
    about each of these is contained in the README file.)
