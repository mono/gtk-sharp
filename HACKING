Before beginning work on something, please post your intentions to the 
mailing list (gtk-sharp-list@ximian.com).  Duplication of effort just gets
folks cranky in general.  

Prior to checking anything into CVS, please send a patch to the mailing list
for approval.  Any patches should be submitted in diff -u format.  Also, it is 
assumed that the submitter has verified that the patch does not break the 
build, and hopefully that it doesn't break runtime.


Getting Started:
----------------

    Getting started with "hacking" Gtk# can seem formidable at first.  However
    there is some additional information already written, to help you get
    up and going.

    Those wishing to "hack" at Gtk#, are encouraged to also read:

        o README.generator
        o sources/README

    If you still have more questions or need assitance, you can get help on
    the Gtk# mailing list and the #mono IRC channel.  (Information about
    each of these is contained in the README file.)
