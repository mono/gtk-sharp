Mono.Posix.dll has been taken from the lib\mono\4.0 directory in the mono-3.12.1 Windows binary release:
http://download.mono-project.com/archive/3.12.1/windows-installer/mono-3.12.1-gtksharp-2.12.26-win32-0.msi

Although newer mono releases exist, this was the last release with properly strong named Mono.Posix DLLs.
Since the msi installer installs those DLLs into the GAC they need to be strong named.
