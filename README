Gtk# is a .NET language binding for the GTK+ toolkit and assorted GNOME
libraries.  Gtk# is free software, licensed under the GNU LGPL.  The target
is the 2.6 platform.

Building & Installing Gtk#:
---------------------------

    Install the gtk-2 development headers first. On Debian, this can be done using:
    apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev libpango1.0-dev libglade2-dev

    The build is the traditional:

        ./configure
        make
        make install

    You may want to consider using configure's prefix option to install
    Gtk# using the same prefix as Mono.  That way all of your .NET assemblies
    get placed in the same place, and you don't need to do any extra "configuring"
    to make it so mono (and mint) can find your assemblies.  In other words,
    doing something like:

        ./configure --prefix=/the/path/that/was/used/for/mono
        make
        make install

    (Of course, replace "/the/path/that/was/used/for/mono" with whatever path
    which was used for Mono.  This might have been "/usr", "/usr/local", or
    something similar.)

    If you are compiling from SVN, you will need libtool and the auto* tools
    and will need to replace the configure above with bootstrap-2.n for whichever
    API version you are building.

    To build a win32 installer, cygwin is required.  Use the mingw-gcc compiler
    and ensure that the autotools are installed, but do not install any of the
    gtk+ libraries from cygwin.  You will need to get the zip bundles for gtk+
    and dependencies, along with libglade and libxml2 from:

    ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries

    for the platform you are building.  Extract all these zips, including the devel
    zips into a single directory and setup your path so that it can access the
    pkg-config tool provided.  You will also want to edit the lib/pkgconfig/*.pc
    files to specify the prefix you installed to.

    Once all that is done, configure away.

    There is a special make target which supports the process of building msi
    installers.  You can make installer-bundle to create a subdirectory named
    gtk-sharp-binaries-<version> which will contain a wxs script and all the
    binaries from the build.  You will also need to copy into this directory the
    msm modules for gtk+, libglade, and mono-cairo.  These can be built
    from svn trunk module win32-installers.  Once those msm's are in place,
    execute the build-installer script to produce the msi.

Discussion & Support:
---------------------

    A mailing list for Gtk# discussion is available.

    You can subscribe to the mailing list by visiting:

    And following the instructions (on that page) to subscribe.
    Messages are posted on this mailing list by sending them to:

    (The mailing list requires you to subscribe in order to post
    messages.)

    An archive of this mailing list can be found at:

    Further, a Wiki is available for Gtk#, and can be found at:

        http://www.nullenvoid.com/gtksharp/wiki/

    Also, people can get help with and discuss Gtk# on IRC via the
    #mono channel on the irc.gnome.org IRC server.

    People looking for general help with C# should visit the
    #c# channel on irc.freenode.net IRC server.


Developers:
-----------

    For developers wishing to "get started" with Gtk#, they are encouraged
    to read the Mono Hand Book:

        http://www.go-mono.com/tutorial

    In the Mono Hand Book, Chapter 21 is on Gtk#.  (In the Mono Hand Book,
    the Gtk# .NET bindings are refered to as GNOME.NET.)


Hackers:
--------

    For those who wish to help with the development of Gtk#, they should
    read the file named: HACKING.

    Also, anyone wishing to hack Gtk# is encouraged to join the Gtk#
    mailing list.  And to visit the #mono IRC channel (on irc.gnome.org).
